## Versioning

Ultra uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for versioning. All packages within the module are versioned
together to ensure compatibility across packages. This means that a breaking change in any package will require a major
version bump, and a non-breaking change will require a minor version bump.

We're planning on maintaining a 1.x.x version for the entire module while new packages are added.
